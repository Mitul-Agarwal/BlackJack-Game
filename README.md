# 🃏 Blackjack Game

A simple Blackjack card game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This is a beginner-friendly project designed to practice DOM manipulation and JavaScript game logic.

## 🎮 Features

- Basic Blackjack rules implemented
- Draw random cards and calculate their sum
- Instant game feedback via messages
- Stylized game board with buttons to start and draw cards
- Player profile with chips

## 🧠 How It Works

- The player starts with two cards.
- Cards have values between 2 and 11 (Face cards are treated as 10, Ace as 11).
- The sum of the cards is calculated:
  - If the sum is ≤ 20, the player can draw a new card.
  - If the sum is exactly 21, the player gets Blackjack.
  - If the sum is over 21, the player loses.
